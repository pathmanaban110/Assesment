    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
       HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. 
       A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
       This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. 
       Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. <span> The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.</span> </p>

     <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
        CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
        It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. <span> 
        CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.</span></p>

        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).
        There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). 
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. <span>
        Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</span></p>

        <p>ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.
        It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and was later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.  
        Facebook developed ReactJS in 2011 in its newsfeed section, but it was released to the public in the month of May 2013.
        Today, most of the websites are built using MVC (model view controller) architecture. <span>In MVC architecture, React is the 'V' which stands for view, whereas the architecture is provided by the Redux or Flux. </span> </p>

        <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.
         It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
        <span> Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</span></p>

        <p>A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has one or more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it holds.
        Other kinds of data stores can also be used, such as files on the file system or large hash tables in memory but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with those type of systems.
        Nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage huge volume of data. 
        <span> This is called relational database because all the data is stored into different tables and relations are established using primary keys or other keys known as Foreign Keys.</span></p>
